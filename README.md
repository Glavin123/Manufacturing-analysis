# 🏭 Manufacturing Analysis Dashboard

## 📘 Project Overview  
The **Manufacturing Analysis Dashboard** project focuses on analyzing production performance using **Excel**, **Power BI**, **Tableau**, and **SQL**.  
It visualizes key manufacturing metrics to identify efficiency, rejection patterns, and departmental performance. Data was imported from a CSV source and analyzed across multiple tools to gain comprehensive insights.

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Microsoft Excel** — for data cleaning and dashboard creation  
- **Power BI** — for advanced visualization and KPI analysis using DAX measures  
- **Tableau** — for interactive dashboards and trend visualization  
- **SQL** — for querying, filtering, and data preparation  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features & Metrics  
The dashboards include critical KPIs and analytical visuals such as:  

- 📦 **Manufacture Quantity** — Total products manufactured  
- ❌ **Rejected Quantity** — Total products rejected  
- ⚙️ **Processed Quantity** — Successfully processed units  
- 🗑️ **Wastage Quantity** — Total manufacturing wastage  
- 🏭 **Machine-Wise Rejected Quantity** — Highlights machines with higher rejection rates  
- 👷 **Employee-Wise Rejected Quantity** — Tracks rejection per employee  
- 🏢 **Department-Wise Manufactured vs Rejected** — Compares departmental performance  
- 📈 **Production Comparison Trend** — Monthly production performance  
- ⚖️ **Manufacture vs Rejected** — Ratio of total produced vs total rejected
